## Learning Goals
1. Use integrals for volumes, arc lengths, and surfaces of revolution.  
2. Apply techniques like u-substitution, integration by parts, and trigonometric substitution.  
3. Analyze infinite series and use Taylor series and Taylor polynomials.  
4. Use derivatives and integrals with parametric and polar equations.  
5. Work with polar and exponential forms of complex numbers.
