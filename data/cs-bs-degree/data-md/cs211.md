## Learning Goals
1. Computer Science majors will be prepared to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and foundations of computer science.  
2. They will acquire a deeper understanding on (elective) topics of more specialized interest, and be able to critically review, assess, and communicate current developments in the field.  
3. They will be prepared for the next step in their careers, for example, by having done a research project, a programming project, or some sort of business plan.
