## Structure
- **Lectures per Week**: 2
- **Workshops per Week**: 1
  - **Workshop Description**:  
    The workshop class is a smaller meeting with a Workshop Instructor (WI), where students engage in group work to solve in-depth problems related to the content delivered in the lectures. Workshops typically require students to complete a pre-class assignment, a write-up of their in-class activity results, and a short quiz following the problem-solving session.
