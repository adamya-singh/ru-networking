## Description
To study a variety of useful algorithms and analyze their complexity; by that experience to gain insight into principles and data-structures useful in algorithm design.

## Prerequisites
- [01:198:112 - Data Structures](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-112-data-structures)
- [01:198:206 - Introduction to Discrete Structures II](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-206-introduction-to-discrete-structures-ii)  
  *Note*: A grade below a "C" in a prerequisite course will not satisfy that prerequisite requirement.

## Topics Covered
1. Methods for expressing and comparing complexity of algorithms: worst and average cases, lower bounds on algorithm classes, verification of correctness.
2. Application of such analysis to a variety of specific algorithms:
   - Searching, merging, sorting (e.g., quick, heap internal, Fibonacci external sorts)
   - Graph problems (e.g., connected components, shortest path, minimum spanning tree, biconnected components)
   - Language problems (e.g., string matching, parsing)
3. Consideration of hard problems: knapsack, satisfiability, traveling salesman problems.
4. Development of NP-complete classification and its consequences.
5. Approximation algorithms.

---

## Expected Work
- Regular exercises
- Approximately 6 small programs

---

## Exams
- Short quizzes
- Midterm and final exam  
  *See Instructor's Class URL for more details.*

## Learning Goals
- Prepare students for contributions in a rapidly changing field with a strong grounding in core principles of computer science.
- Foster deeper understanding of specialized topics and critical assessment of current developments.
- Prepare students for careers through projects such as research, programming, or business planning.
