## Learning goals

Throughout the course, students will learn about low-level programming, digital logic, and the memory hierarchy via case studies that are representative of real-world computer systems.

Students will apply essential knowledge about computer systems to modify and create new low-level software and hardware implementations via hands-on programming exercises.

At the end of this course, students should have the preliminary skills to design and evaluate solutions involving the computer software-hardware interface to address new problems.

## Topics

  * C programming
  * Data representation and computer arithmetic
  * Assembly language programming
  * Boolean algebra
  * Basic digital logic design
  * Processor design
  * Cache design
  * Main memory design



## Recommended textbooks

  * [Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective (CS:APP, 3rd ed.)](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/)
  * [Modern C (https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/)](https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/)



## Expected work and grading policy

  * 6 programming assignments, 12% of the course grade each
  * weekly short timed quizzes, 2% of the course grade each
  * class and recitation participation
  * discussion via Piazza



The course letter grade will be assigned according to this scale. A: 100%–90%. B+: 89.9%–87%. B: 86.9%–80%. C+: 79.9%–77%. C: 76.9%–70%. D: 69.9%–60%.
