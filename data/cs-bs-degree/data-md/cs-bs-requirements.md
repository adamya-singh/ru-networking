# Department of Computer Science

## Notes
- The above requirements apply to all current computer science majors.
- Prior to fall 2011, the BS required either 01:198:113 or 214, plus 314 and 416. Students now have the option of substituting other electives for these courses.
- Courses for which a student receives a grade of D cannot be used to satisfy prerequisite requirements.
- Requirements to register for CS graduate classes are available on the [CS Honors page](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-degrees/cs-honors-program).
