## CS 205 - Introduction to Discrete Structures I 

## Course Description

This course introduces student to the mathematical tools of logic and induction, and to the basic definitions and theorems concerning relations, functions, and sets. Later courses in the computer science curriculum build on the mathematical foundations covered here. Particular emphasis is placed on inductive definitions and proofs, with application to problems in computer science. Special topics such as finite state automata and modular arithmetic will be discussed. The course covers 6 major topics. The order of the coverage may vary based on instructor preference. Please refer to individual professor's canvas course page for more details.

**  Course Learning Goals**

**A.** Prepare students to contribute to a rapidly changing field by acquiring a thorough grounding in the core principles and mathematical foundations of computer science (e.g., techniques of program analysis, proof techniques such as induction; basic foundations of theoretical computer science).

**B.** Students will acquire a deeper understanding on the abstract models of computing such as finite state automata, Turing machines and build programs based on these models of computing. 

**C.** Students will be prepared for the upcoming theoretical computer science courses in the curriculum as well as explaining the ability to reason about programs, a key component in software validation.** **

## Lecture Sections

**Textbook and Discussions  **

**Textbook** : Discrete Mathematics and its applications, Kenneth Rosen, Rutgers Edition, 7th Edition, ISBN-978-1259-15215-4.  You can purchase a copy of the book from any vendor.

**Discussions :    **Some sections may have discussions on Piazza or on canvas. Please visit you section webpage for more information.

**_Supplemental_ CUbits Videos (not a replacement to lecture)**

**Supplemental Videos** : A curated video collection is provided to you as an assistance to further understanding topics or catch up with missed lectures. Videos are recorded by Rutgers Instructors as well as other instructors. 

**IMPORTANT**. The videos are NOT a replacement to the lectures. They are supplemental and just that. _Lecture attendance is required_. However, if you miss the lecture or did not understand a specific concept, these cubits videos can help. Follow the steps below to get access to videos. **No credit** will be given for watching/completing CUbits assessments.

**Step 1.** Create a free account at cubits.ai - <https://www.api.cubits.ai/accounts/signup/>   (be sure to validate account. Check spam folder if needed).

**Use the Rutgers Email in the form** : [netID@rutgers.edu](mailto:netID@rutgers.edu)

Textbook **Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications** , 2nd Edition, Kenneth Rosen,  (Rutgers Edition is Recommended, as it contains only the required chapters)

### Academic Integrity

You are responsible for reading and understanding the [DCS Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-integrity-policy). Read the overview as well as the specific policies for exams. Instances of cheating will be punished by a zero grade, a failing grade for the course, and/or referral to your dean, at the discretion of the course staff.

All assignments and exams are individual but we encourage collaboration with course staff and classmates. However, you must be careful how you collaborate. Use the guidelines bellow for reference:

| Course staff | Classmates | Other people  
---|---|---|---  
Discuss concepts with: | Yes | Yes | Yes  
Acknowledge collaboration with: | Yes | Yes | Yes  
Expose code/solutions to: | Yes | No | No  
Copy code/solutions from: | No | No | No  
  
### Recitations

 _Attend the recitation you are registered for_

### _Problem Sets/ Homework_

Plan to submit your assignments on time, no late assignments are accepted.

Assignments are graded **Always read the feedback!**

Plan to submit your work with at least one day in advance to avoid any submission issues. 

### Grading

### Written assignments and exams are graded by TAs in Gradescope/Canvas (depending on section) and you will receive your score about 10 days after the assignment due date or exam date.

### Regrades

For written assignments, quizzes and exams, you have one week after the grades are released to ask for a regrade. Only ask for a regrade if you think there was a grading error, do not request a regrade simply because you think you deserve more partial credit. For more information about regrades please refer to the syllabus (on Canvas).

### Canvas

Canvas is a course management tool that will be used to keep students scores and send out announcements. Once registered to the course you will be automatically added to Canvas. Use your Rutgers credentials to login.

The course staff expects all students to read the announcements.

### Exams

## Please Consult the Instructor's course Canvas page for Updated information.  
These some general guidelines.

=========================================================================

  * All exams are given in-person
  * You will have 80 consecutive minutes to complete a midterm exam and 3 consecutive hours to complete the final exam. 



There are NO makeup exams. 

Students that require accommodations, such as extra time, must contact [ODS](https://ods.rutgers.edu/) at least two weeks before the quiz date. Email your accommodations letter to the course instructor. Extra time will be added to your exam allowed time

### Grading

Please consult your section instructor for more details about grading criteria.

**There is no curve** : you must earn a minimum of 90% of the total points for an A, 85% for a B+, 80% for a B, 75% for a C+, 70% for a C, and 60% for a D. You will fail the course if you earn less than 60% points.

The cutoffs are **strictly followed** for each letter grade. A computed grade of 74.99% is a C not a C+.

#### There are no other extra credits activities for the course. No exceptions.
